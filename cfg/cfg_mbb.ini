;
;      - Settings:
;        The settings required to setup the CRIO environment are here
;           - Destination Crio IP: The IP address of the target CRIO
;                        For safety, our intention is to keep this
;                        IP as the loopback address (127.0.0.1)
;           - Path: is the path to the bitfile that will be used to configure
;                   the FPGA of the target CRIO.
;           - Bitfile Name: Is the name of the bitfile
;           - Signature: Is the Signature of that specific bitfile
;           - Use Shared Memory: Set to 1 if labviewRT will open a shared memory
;           - Shared Memory Path: If Use Shared Memory is set to 1, then this path
;                       will be used.
;           - Shared Memory Size: If Use Shared Memory is set to 1, then the size is used
;      - WAVEFORMS:
;        Nheengatu will look for the details of every wavefrom in another record
;        The Waveform fields are
;          - <Type> : can be I08, I16, I32, I64, U08, U16, U32, U64, SGL, DBL
;          - <Address> : RT index
;          - <Size> : Number of elements in the array
;      - BIAddresses:
;        Single address of BI vector (upto 64-bits). Must have BI0 as the single item.
;      - BI0:
;        A list with all the BIs that will be read by Nheengatu and their respective index
;      - AO:
;        A list with all the AOs that will be read by Nheengatu and their respective addresses
;      - AI:
;        A list with all the AIs that will be read by Nheengatu and their respective addresses
;      - BO:
;        A list with all the BOs that will be read by Nheengatu and their respective addresses
;      - SCALERS:
;        A list with all the BOs that will be read by Nheengatu and their respective addresses.
;        Each item in this list will need a new record with the following parameters
;          - <Gate> : Gate array address
;          - <Number of Counters> : Number of counters implemented
;          - <Done> : address of the done flag
;          - <OneShot>: Address of the oneshot flag
;          - <Counters> : Address of the counter array
;          - <Preset Values>: Address of the preset array
;          - <Enable>: address if the enable array
;      - FXP_XX:
;        For each FXP in AI/AO, and FXP record is needed with the following parameters
;          - <Word Length> (currently fixed to 64)
;          - <Sign> can be 0 (unSigned) or 1 (Signed)
;          - <Integer Word Length> can be any value between 0 and 64.
;
;
;Naming Considerations:
;    FPGA Variables:
;        Fixed point AI and AO variables should start with "FXP" keyword.
;        Every FXP variable need to have the following attributes defined
;        in another record as mentioned above.
;
;
;
;    RT Variables:
;        The keyword RT_ is reserved for variables that are defined
;        in labview RT. Do not use this reserved word in your names
;        unless it is an RT variable, otherwise it will be ignored!
;        In case of AI, AO, BI, BO, WF, Keywords for realtime double, single,
;        Signed 8, 16, 32, 64 and unSigned 8, 16, 32, 64 are defined as follows
;        Double          : RT_DBL_<NAME>
;        Single          : RT_SGL_<NAME>
;        UnSigned 64 bit : RT_U64_<NAME>
;        UnSigned 32 bit : RT_U32_<NAME>
;        UnSigned 16 bit : RT_U16_<NAME>
;        UnSigned 08 bit : RT_U08_<NAME>
;        Signed 64 bit   : RT_I64_<NAME>
;        Signed 32 bit   : RT_I32_<NAME>
;        Signed 16 bit   : RT_I16_<NAME>
;        Signed 08 bit   : RT_I08_<NAME>
;
;
;Checks implemented in the library:
; Checking for same address / index within a category has been
; implemented. An exception is throw upon occurance.
;
;
;Note that the binary input address that comes from the FPGA is always set to
;BI0. The library looks for this specific string, so it must be BI0 although
;you may have named it differently in the FPGA VI.
