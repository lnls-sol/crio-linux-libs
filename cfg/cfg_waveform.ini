; Automatically generated ini file for CRIO library
; The settings required to setup the CRIO environment are here
; - Destination Crio IP: The IP address of the target CRIO
;                        For safety, our intention is to keep this
;                        IP as the loopback address (127.0.0.1)
; - Path: is the path to the bitfile that will be used to configure
;         the FPGA of the target CRIO.
; - Bitfile Name: Is the name of the bitfile
; - Signature: Is the signature of that specific bitfile
; - Use Shared Memory: Set to 1 if labviewRT will open a shared memory
; - Shared Memory Path: If Use Shared Memory is set to 1, then this path
;                       will be used.

;
;Naming Considerations:
;    RT Variables:
;        The keyword RT_ is reserved for variables that are defined 
;        in labview RT. Do not use this reserved word in your names
;        unless it is an RT variable, otherwise it will be ignored!
;        Keywords for realtime double, single, signed 8, 16, 32, 64 
;        and unsigned 8, 16, 32, 64 are defined as follows
;        Double          : RT_DBL_<NAME>
;        Single          : RT_SGL_<NAME>
;        Unsigned 64 bit : RT_U64_<NAME>
;        Unsigned 32 bit : RT_U32_<NAME>
;        Unsigned 16 bit : RT_U16_<NAME>
;        Unsigned 08 bit : RT_U08_<NAME>
;        Signed 64 bit   : RT_I64_<NAME>
;        Signed 32 bit   : RT_I32_<NAME>
;        Signed 16 bit   : RT_I16_<NAME>
;        Signed 08 bit   : RT_I08_<NAME>
;
;    FPGA variables naming:
;        FPGA variables must have one of the following keywords:
;        AI, AO, BI, BO 
;
;
;Checks implemented in the library:
; Checking for same address / index within a category has been
; implemented. An exception is throw upon occurance.
