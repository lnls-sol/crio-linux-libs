; The settings required to setup the CRIO environment are here
; - Destination Crio IP: The IP address of the target CRIO
;                        For safety, our intention is to keep this
;                        IP as the loopback address (127.0.0.1)
; - Path: is the path to the bitfile that will be used to configure
;         the FPGA of the target CRIO.
; - Bitfile Name: Is the name of the bitfile
; - Signature: Is the signature of that specific bitfile
; - Use Shared Memory: Set to 1 if labviewRT will open a shared memory
; - Shared Memory Path: If Use Shared Memory is set to 1, then this path
;                       will be used.

; Checking for same address / index within a category has been

; This contains the BI addresses if more than one exist. In
